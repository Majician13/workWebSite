			<li>Pull 25 pin cable from Lantronix (in server room).</li>
			<li>Place paperclip (or jumper) in pin 2 and pin 3 (See pic).</li>
			<img src="images/Picture1.jpg" alt="RS-485 port" width="200" height="300" />
			<li>Open Putty.</li>
			<li>Click on “Terminal” tab.</li>
			<li>Under “Local Echo”, Click “Force On”</li>
			<li>Under “Local Line Editing”, Click “Force Off”</li>
			<li>Click on “Session” tab.</li>
			<li>
				Under “Host Name (or IP Address)”, type IP for card reader you are attempting to reach.
			</li>
			<li>Under “Port”, Type “8001”</li>
			<li>Click “Open”.</li>
			<li>
				Type one letter at a time slowly. If you type “a”, you should see two (2) a’s show on the
				screen, “aa”. If you do not see two letters, the Lantronix most likely needs to be replaced.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you do see two of each letter you type, Pull the jumper from pins 2 and 3 and replace the
				25 pin cable.
			</li>
			<li>Go to the B&B converter nearest to the card reader.</li>
			<li>
				Pull the 9 pin cable and place the jumper into pins 2 and 3 on the converter. (See pic).
			</li>
			<img src="images/Picture2.jpg" alt="db-9 port" width="200" height="300" />
			<li>
				Type in Putty. Again, you should see two of each letter. If not, Verify that the cable going
				between converters is correct by ohming each wire to ground and then twisting the red/black
				wires that are next to each other together and ohming them out from the other end to ensure
				the correct black wire is with the correct color wire. If everything ohms out, the
				converters need to be replaced. If they do not ohm out correctly, the cable needs to be
				replaced.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you do see two letters that you typed, the converters are working normally. You can then
				go to the card reader and remove the red and white wires coming from the converter and twist
				them together. (See pic).
			</li>
			<img src="images/Picture3.jpg" alt="wire terminal inside ICU" width="200" height="300" />
			<li>
				Repeat the loopback test. If you see double letters, but are still unable to get status from
				the card reader in TSU, the MK II board needs replacement.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you are unable to see the double letters at this point, the cable with the red/white
				wires is faulty and needs replacement.
			</li>
